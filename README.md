# My Rails App

This is a Ruby on Rails application.

## Requirements

- Ruby (check `.ruby-version` for the required version)
- Rails (check `Gemfile` for the required version)
- PostgreSQL or SQLite (depending on your database configuration)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```sh
   rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```sh
   rails server
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Tests

Run the test suite with:
```sh
rails test  # For Minitest
rspec       # For RSpec (if used)
```

## Deployment

For production deployment, ensure:
- The database is properly set up
- ENV variables are configured
- Assets are precompiled (`rails assets:precompile`)
- A production server (e.g., Puma, Nginx, Heroku, AWS) is properly configured
